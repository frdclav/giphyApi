Check it out [here](http://frdc.info/giphyApi)

Using javascript and ajax, we are able to hit the giphyApi and have gifs returned for the chosen topic/search term

# how can we improve
Currently only returns 10 gifs, we can update to add more results when requested.
We can also improve on the visual/UI/UX
Implement other apis to return other things
return more info on gifs?
